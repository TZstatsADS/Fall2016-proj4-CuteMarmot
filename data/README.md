# Project: Words 4 Music
### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

In this fold, I unload all data fild I have created during my modeling and testing. The data filds have the name _test is the dataset I created of testing. In the first step, I merged the dataset of loudness_max, loudness_max_time, piches and timbre and make them into the same dimension. Then, I did k-means of this merged dataset and give each variable a category. The result is named Input_Data. Then I did topic modeling and the out come is named outcome_label. Then, I average the ranking of words of songs which belong to the same category by topic modeling and give the unique ranking of each label. This dataset is named ranking. Then, I used my model to make prediction. The predicted result is the category of new songs. Then I give the new song the words ranking belongs to this category. During my test, I make new input data, and new ranking_test. There are some unimportant dataset which is over the limit of max size of github, so I didn't unload them.
